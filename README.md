# üîÑ Asynchronous FIFO Design & Verification in SystemVerilog

## Clock-Domain Crossing FIFO with Gray Code Synchronization and Functional Verification

This repository presents a **SystemVerilog-based RTL design and verification** of an **Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** memory module. It focuses on enabling **reliable data transfer between independent clock domains** using Gray code synchronization. The design and verification were developed using standard HDL simulation practices and verified with a self-contained testbench.

## üîç Project Overview

This digital design project implements an Asynchronous FIFO featuring:

- **Dual-Clock Domains**: Independent write and read clocks for real-time asynchronous data handling.
- **Pointer Synchronization**: Gray-coded pointer conversion for metastability-resilient clock domain crossing.
- **FIFO Control Logic**: Efficient generation of Full, Empty, and Valid flags.
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of write/read logic, memory buffer, and synchronization blocks.

## üß™ Verification Overview

The testbench includes:

- üìå Reset Condition Check  
- üìå Write and Read Operations under different clock frequencies  
- üìå Boundary Condition Tests (Full & Empty flags)  
- üìå Stress Testing Across Clock Domains  

>üß† Note: This testbench does not use the UVM library, but follows a modular verification structure with components like driver, monitor, and scoreboard written in pure SystemVerilog. It demonstrates fundamental verification concepts such as stimulus generation, observation, and result checking using mailbox-based communication.
